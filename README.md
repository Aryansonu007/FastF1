# 🏎️ FastF1 Learning Repository

Welcome to my FastF1 learning project! This repository contains scripts, notebooks, and experiments as I explore the [FastF1 API](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/) — a Python library for accessing and analyzing Formula 1 session data.

> 📌 **Objective:** Document and share my learning process through hands-on examples and visualizations using real F1 telemetry.
